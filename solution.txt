To resolve the build issues, follow these steps: 

1. Update next.config.js to enable static exports and proper path aliasing.
2. Create simplified versions of error pages that don't rely on UI components.
3. Setup proper jsconfig.json and tsconfig.json for path aliasing.

Key change is to remove dependencies on @/components/ui/button and other UI components by:
- Using native HTML elements with tailwind classes directly
- Setting the output to 'export' mode to generate static HTML
- Fixing path aliases in the configuration files

For each error page (404.js, _error.js, etc.) replace UI component imports with simple HTML elements styled with Tailwind CSS.
